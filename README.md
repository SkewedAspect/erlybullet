# ErlyBullet

This is a set of erlang bindings to the [bullet physics library](http://www.bulletphysics.com/), wrapped in a port.

## Status

This is just an initial fork of the project from [nialscorva/erlybullet](https://github.com/nialscorva/erlybullet).
No work's been done to clean up the code, or otherwise improve the project. For now, we're simply forking it, adding this 
Readme, and then we'll be evaluating how to modify the project to suit our needs.
